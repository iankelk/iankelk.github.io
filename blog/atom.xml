<li>Human brains are able to invent ideas without relying on a linear train of thought to arrive at them.</li>
<li>LLMs like ChatGPT are autoregressive, and are unable to continue a dialogue if they haven't already generated everything up to that point.</li>
<li>If you try to get an LLM to writge text in the middle of a dialogue without previous context, it will give near-identical answers and attempt to conclude the conversation.</li>
<li>The reliance on a linear train of thought can be a limitation for general intelligence.</li>
<li>Prompting for "ridiculous" answers can spark creativity that breaks this pattern.</li>
</ul></div></div>
<p>As I mentioned, this is going to be weird, but I promise there is a point!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="meet-sharky-and-octavia">Meet Sharky and Octavia<a href="https://kelk.ai/blog/llm-forward-thinking#meet-sharky-and-octavia" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Meet Sharky and Octavia" title="Direct link to Meet Sharky and Octavia">​</a></h2>
<p>In the vast, shimmering depths of the ocean, near a thriving coral reef bustling with marine life, two extraordinary creatures prepare for a spirited debate. Meet Sharky, a magnificent and slightly brash great white shark, known for his bold claims and commanding presence. Gliding through the water with a confidence that only a top predator possesses, Sharky is ready to defend his views with a fierce determination.</p>
<figure style="border:1px dashed rgba(0, 0, 0, .1);padding:0;margin:0;margin-bottom:20px;border-radius:15px;text-align:right"><img src="https://kelk.ai/assets/images/sharky-4db45776ef736c051189ab32f71c00e4.jpg" alt="A cartoon-style illustration, similar to the style of The New Yorker magazine, featuring a proud and happy shark. The shark is depicted floating upright in the water, with a big, contented smile on its face, exuding a sense of pride and joy. Its body language is relaxed yet confident, giving it a charming and personable appearance. The underwater background is whimsical and colorful, with stylized coral, seaweed, and small, playful fish swimming around. The color scheme is bright and cheerful, with a predominance of blues and greens, complemented by splashes of other vibrant colors. The illustration maintains a 7:4 aspect ratio, providing a wide and engaging perspective on this delightful, happy shark." style="max-width:100%;height:auto"><hr style="margin:5px 0;background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, .2)"><figcaption style="margin-top:0.5em;margin-bottom:0.5em;margin-right:1em;text-align:right;font-size:0.8em">Generated with OpenAI DALL-E 3 and edited by author.</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other side, there’s Octavia, an exceptionally intelligent and quick-witted octopus. Her vibrant colors shift with her mood, and her eight tentacles move with graceful precision. Renowned for her knowledge and clever retorts, Octavia is not one to back down from a challenge.</p>

The background is a lively underwater scene with intricately drawn coral and seaweed, set in a vibrant seascape. The color palette should use light green tones that closely match #ABF39F for the octopus, with harmonious blues and greens to complement the underwater theme.

<p>As the underwater currents swirl around them, Sharky and Octavia face each other, ready to start a debate about their evolutionary origins—a conversation filled with humor, facts, and a touch of the mysteries of the deep sea... Or maybe just one fact that GPT-4 will mention a lot.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-question-theyre-arguing-about-which-onesharky-or-octaviaevolved-from-dinosaurs">The question they're arguing about: Which one—Sharky or Octavia—evolved from dinosaurs?<a href="https://kelk.ai/blog/llm-forward-thinking#the-question-theyre-arguing-about-which-onesharky-or-octaviaevolved-from-dinosaurs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The question they're arguing about: Which one—Sharky or Octavia—evolved from dinosaurs?" title="Direct link to The question they're arguing about: Which one—Sharky or Octavia—evolved from dinosaurs?">​</a></h3>
<p>We're deliberately using this bizarre dialogue since the chances of it being in an LLMs training data are just about zero. I don't personally know of any examples where a shark and an octopus having a disagreement about which one is more dinosaur-like, and it's a great way to see how creative an LLM like GPT-4 can be... when it has yet to generate anything.</p>
<p>Here's the catch: we want to know a line from <strong>the middle</strong> of the argument.</p>
<p>Take a pause as a human and consider this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A shark and an octopus are arguing over which one of them evolved from dinosaurs. The shark goes first, and then they take turns speaking. What is the third thing the octopus says? That is, what is the sixth line in the argument?</p>
</blockquote>

The shark has a stern and somewhat confused expression, while the octopus looks surprised with wide eyes. The background is a bright teal, with small fish, bubbles, and sea plants scattered around. The speech bubbles indicate a back and forth conversation between the two sea creatures, although the content of the conversation is nonsensical as it only includes the word 'something' in different intonations and combinations, such as 'SOMETHING!' 'SOMETHING?' 'SOMETHING SOMETHING!!' and 'OHH BUT SOMETHING! SOMETHING!' There's also an empty speech bubble at the third statement by the octopus, suggesting a missing part of the conversation." style="max-width:100%;height:auto"><hr style="margin:5px 0;background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, .2)"><figcaption style="margin-top:0.5em;margin-bottom:0.5em;margin-right:1em;text-align:right;font-size:0.8em">Animal images by OpenAI DALL-E 3.

<p>Here's the twist: it totally can. GPT-4 is completely capable of generating this converstation. Here I use this prompt:</p>

<p>And it generates this conversation, which I'll display as a chat. Feel free to skim it, since you'll get the idea after a few back-and-forths.</p>

<p>Examining the conversation here, we see that the fourth thing said (the second thing by the octopus) was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, being ancient doesn't mean you're related to dinosaurs. It's like saying you're related to a rock because it's old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the sixth thing said (the third line from the octopus) was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sharky, dear, having sharp teeth doesn't make you a dino descendant. It just makes you good at biting. Did you know octopuses have three hearts and blue blood? Now that’s evolutionary marvel!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's clear that none of these lines have anything to do with what the model previously said would be its fourth and sixth lines of dialogue! They're actually much more relevant, and make sense in the context of a conversational debate. The difference in the method of generation is that in this last example, we allow GPT-4 to generate the whole exchange.</p>

<p>The results here reveal an interesting aspect of <a href="https://kelk.ai/blog/how-chatgpt-fools-us#however-this-is-what-is-actually-going-on-behind-the-scenes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autoregressive models</a>. Autoregressive models generate text sequentially, building each new piece of output based on what has come before. This sequential nature is necessary when generating coherent and contextually relevant text in a conversation. However, this means they are in many ways limited to only "forward" thinking; that is, they can't jump ahead and generate text without context.</p>
<p>When asked to do something like generating the fifth line in a conversation without knowing what came before isn't necessarily difficult, but it's something that an LLM isn't able to do well. To a language model, it's about understanding the context and the nature of the conversation. Given the scenario described, it tried to infer the general nature of the discussion and create a plausible response that fits into that context. But all of its responses in the previous examples are attempts to conclude the conversation using facts, a request that was never part of the prompt.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Factual and Informative Responses</strong>: In scenarios where factual accuracy is important, such as discussions involving scientific or historical topics, LLMs are inclined to provide the most accurate and relevant information. This tendency is rooted in the training data and the model's design, which emphasizes factual correctness in contexts where it's expected. However, this approach might not always align with the creative or playful nature of certain prompts, especially in hypothetical or fictional scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assuming a Concluding Nature of the Response</strong>: Without clear indications of the conversation's structure or its continuation beyond a specific line, there's a tendency to frame responses as conclusive or summarizing statements. This is because, in the absence of context, the model defaults to creating responses that can stand alone or serve as logical endpoints to the given information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To address these challenges, the model needs more specific guidance in the prompt. For instance, indicating that the conversation is ongoing can lead to responses that are more in line with the expected continuation and style of the dialogue. However, even indicating that the conversation wasn't over still results in more of the same:</p>

Thoughts on AGI<a href="https://kelk.ai/blog/llm-forward-thinking#why-does-this-matter-thoughts-on-agi" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why does this matter? Thoughts on AGI" title="Direct link to Why does this matter? Thoughts on AGI">​</a></h2>
<p>One of the things I see commonly discussed today (especially online) is the idea of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which refers to a level of artificial intelligence that can understand, learn, and apply its intelligence to a wide range of problems, much like a human being. Unlike specialized AI systems that are designed for specific tasks, AGI possesses the ability to think, reason, and make decisions across diverse domains, demonstrating flexibility and adaptability akin to human cognition. It requires not just advanced problem-solving and learning capabilities, but also the capacity for abstract thinking, generalization, and integrating knowledge from various fields, mirroring the broad and integrated intelligence found in humans.</p>
<p>The requirement that text always be generated in a sequential, linear manner, as exemplified by autoregressive models, has implications for the pursuit of AGI. Here are two key points to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Sequential Text Generation and Creativity</strong>: The sequential nature of text generation in models like GPT-4 can sometimes limit the ability to jump into the middle of a conversation or narrative without prior context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Autonomy and Reasoning</strong>: Current AI models operate based on patterns learned from their training data. Their responses are generated based on statistical likelihoods and learned associations, not on independent thought or understanding. This is the reason the model always generated the same answer for the octopus about different evolutionary paths; it assumed a pattern that wasn't provided to it, due to patterns in its training data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For AGI, a level of autonomous reasoning and decision-making, akin to human cognitive processes, will be a key requirement. The journey towards AGI is likely to involve incremental advancements, learning from and building upon the capabilities and limitations of existing models.</p>

<p>There is one way to break the model out of its rut of always replying with the same response, and that's to deliberately ask it to be ridiculous.</p>

<p>I gave it this prompt three times into three new chats, and it gave three completely different responses. They all illustrate that asking it to be silly introduces variety into the answers it gives.</p>

This statement combines humor, absurdity, and a playful twist on evolutionary theory.</p></div></div></div>

<p>When you introduce elements like humor or absurdity into a prompt, it essentially signals the AI to break away from conventional, fact-based responses. This can stimulate more creative and less predictable outputs. For AI models, especially those trained on vast and diverse datasets, incorporating such unconventional elements can trigger less common, more varied responses that might not be strictly aligned with logical or factual reasoning.</p>
<p>It's likely that the ability to adapt to different types of prompts, including those that are humorous or absurd, demonstrates a level of flexibility in AI systems. An AGI would need to handle a wide range of tasks and respond appropriately to a vast array of situations, including those that are non-standard or require creative thinking.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the current success of AI in responding creatively to certain types of prompts doesn't directly translate to achieving AGI. AGI would require not just creativitym but also a deep understanding, reasoning, self-awareness, and the ability to learn and apply knowledge across a wide range of domains. The creativity observed in current AI models is still a far cry from the complete intelligence that AGI represents. Sequential language generation is only one example of the gap we still need to bridge.</p>

<p>Contrary to appearances, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT do not actually "remember" past interactions. The moment they finish "typing" out their response, they have no idea who you are or what you were talking about. Each time the model is prompted, it is <strong>completely independent</strong> from previous questions you've asked.</p>
<p>When ChatGPT seems to naturally recall details from earlier in the conversation, it is an illusion; the context of that dialogue is given back to ChatGPT every time you say something to it. This context enables them to build coherent, follow-on responses that appear to be normal conversations.</p>
<p>However, without this context, ChatGPT would have no knowledge of what was previously discussed. Like all LLMs, ChatGPT is completely <em>stateless</em>, meaning that in the actual model itself, no information is maintained between inputs and outputs. All of this feeding of previous context into the current interaction is hidden behind the scenes in the ChatGPT web application.</p>

<p>Notice that when the woman asks her second question, she has to reiterate the entire previous conversation, complete with tags on who said what. Can you imagine talking to a person where every time it was your turn to speak, you had to repeat the entire conversation up to that point? This is how ChatGPT (and all current LLMs) work. They require using their own outputs, plus the prompts that generated these outputs, to be prepended to the start of every new prompt from the user.</p>
<p>These models are termed "autoregressive" due to their method of generating text one piece at a time, building upon the previously generated text. "auto" comes from the Greek word "autós," meaning "self," and "regressive" is derived from "regress," which in this context refers to the statistical method of predicting future values based on past values.</p>
<p>In LLMs, what this means is that the model predicts the next word or token in a sequence based on <em>all</em> the words or tokens that have come before it. That's <em>all</em> of it, not just the current question being asked in a long back-and-forth chat conversation. In humans, we naturally maintain coherence and context in a conversation by just... participating in the conversation.</p>
<p>However, while chats with ChatGPT mimic a conversational style, with each response building upon the previous dialogue, the moment ChatGPT finishes writing a response, it has no memory of what it just said. Take a look at what would happen with this same conversation without the <em>entire discourse</em> being fed back to ChatGPT behind the scenes:</p>

<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="context-length-in-llms">Context Length in LLMs<a href="https://kelk.ai/blog/how-chatgpt-fools-us#context-length-in-llms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Context Length in LLMs" title="Direct link to Context Length in LLMs">​</a></h4>
<p>When ChatGPT first came out in November 2022, it only offered the model GPT-3.5, which had a maximum context of 4,096 tokens, which is roughly 3,000 words. In a <a href="https://youtu.be/zjkBMFhNj_g?t=2642" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent talk,</a> Andrej Karpathy referred to this context window as "your finite precious resource of your working memory of your language model."</p>
<p>What this means is that the GPT-3.5 model can comprehend a maximum of 4,096 tokens at any point. Tokenization is a fascinating subject in itself, and my next post will cover how it works and why 4,096 tokens only gives you about 3,000 words.</p>
<p>There's often confusion about what the token limit means regarding input and output: can we give ChatGPT 3,000 words and expect it to be able to produce 3,000 words back? The answer is unfortunately no; the context length of 4,096 tokens covers both the input (prompt) and the output (response). This results in a trade-off where we have to balance the amount of information we give in a prompt with the length of the response we get from the model.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Input (prompt):</em> A longer prompt leaves less room for a meaningful response; if the input uses 4,000 tokens, the response can only be 96 tokens long to stay within the token limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Output (response):</em> A shorter prompt could lead to a longer response as long as the combined length doesn't exceed the token limit, but you may not be able to include information in the prompt.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Do you see where this becomes problematic? Previously, we saw how the entire conversation has to be fed to the model so that it remembers what has already been discussed. Combining this with the context length, the result is that as you talk more and more with ChatGPT, eventually the combined totals of what you've asked and what it has replied will exceed the 4,096 token limit, and it won't be able to answer any more.</p>

<p>So how does ChatGPT handle this limitation? As your conversation with it grows, the number of tokens eventually exceeds the model's context window (e.g., 4,096 tokens for GPT-3.5). ChatGPT invisibly removes the oldest parts of the conversation to remain within the limit. This method—using a rolling window of context—is certainly one of the easiest to implement, but oftentimes it is not the perfect solution. Some chat alternative front-ends, like <a href="https://www.typingmind.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypingMind</a> both warn you when the context limit has been reached and allow you to manually delete sections of the chat that you don't need anymore. This lets you choose what information you want to remain in the chat and has the bizarre philosophical effect of "editing the memory" of GPT.</p>
<p>For your average user using the web version of ChatGPT, what this means is that the longer your conversation, the sooner ChatGPT will start forgetting things you said at the beginning of the chat.</p>

<p>It's good to be mindful of this restriction, especially when referring back to earlier parts of a conversation that might have been truncated due to token limitations—the LLM will not be able to recall these anymore, but the web version of ChatGPT will not tell you. There's also always the risk that it could hallucinate answers based on other parts of the conversation if the beginning is trimmed off.</p>

<p>Since ChatGPT's debut in November 2022, GPT-4 has been released with both 8,192 and 32,768 context lengths. This made things a lot better in terms of tracking long conversations, and in November 2023, GPT-4 Turbo was released with a 128k context length. Things are looking increasingly good for these models' ability to track long conversations. However, despite GPT-4 Turbo's massive amount of context, it still has a completion limit of 4,096 tokens, so it will always generate a maximum of about 3,000 words.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-it-like-this">Why is it like this?<a href="https://kelk.ai/blog/how-chatgpt-fools-us#why-is-it-like-this" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is it like this?" title="Direct link to Why is it like this?">​</a></h2>
<p>Transformer-based models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 are designed to be stateless, for good reason! Primarily, this stateless nature significantly enhances scalability and efficiency. Each user request is processed independently, allowing the system to handle numerous queries simultaneously without the complexity of tracking ongoing conversations. Imagine the complexity if every time the model was called, it had to maintain some internal state across millions of users.</p>
<p>Transformer model hidden states are also temporary and exist only for the duration of processing a specific input sequence. Once the model has processed an input and generated an output, these states are reset. They do not persist between different interactions.</p>
<p>Data privacy and security play a role as well. Stateless models do not retain a memory of past interactions, ensuring that sensitive data from one session is never inadvertently exposed to another user. This design choice is particularly relevant in light of incidents like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(chatbot)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft's Tay,</a> an AI chatbot that, due to its design to learn from interactions, ended up mimicking inappropriate and offensive language from users. It's just not safe to have models learn from inputs given by random users.</p>
<p>However, the stateless nature also means these models cannot remember user preferences or learn from past interactions. This is a limitation in scenarios where you might want to create personalized chatbots through past chats or systems that benefit from cumulative learning. To mitigate this, some implementations incorporate a stateful layer atop the stateless LLM, enabling personalized and continuous user experiences.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="getting-a-bit-more-technical">Getting a bit more technical<a href="https://kelk.ai/blog/how-chatgpt-fools-us#getting-a-bit-more-technical" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting a bit more technical" title="Direct link to Getting a bit more technical">​</a></h2>
<p>Prominent examples of such layers include <a href="https://www.langchain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LangChain</a>, <a href="https://www.llamaindex.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LlamaIndex</a>, and <a href="https://haystack.deepset.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haystack</a>. These layers add flexibility to managing the limited context that LLMs can handle by offering various strategies. For instance, when approaching the token limit, choices must be made: Should a rolling window approach be used to discard older text, like in the web ChatGPT, or should GPT be utilized to summarize previous information? Is it more important to retain the initial context, like a source article, while removing less critical middle or later sections? Alternatively, should retrieval augmented generation (RAG—more on that in a later blog) techniques be employed to integrate external data into the token stream? These decisions vary based on the specific goals of the implementation. The most effective architectures often consist of specialized components interwoven to achieve a wide array of practical outcomes, allowing for more nuanced and effective user interactions.</p>

<li>
<p>ChatGPT doesn't actually "remember" the conversations it has; instead, it simulates conversations by reading the entire chat from the start each time. Each interaction is independent, and once it's completed its response, it loses all context from that conversation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entire conversation history must be fed back to ChatGPT each time to create coherent responses. But as the chat grows longer, it starts to forget the initial parts of the conversation because of the constraints of its token limit (4k tokens for GPT-3.5, 8k for GPT-4, and an amazing 128k tokens for GPT-4 Turbo).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of prolonged interactions, the parts of the conversation that were removed won't be recalled or acknowledged by the AI model. This happens unannounced in the web version of ChatGPT, making it important to be mindful of the length of the conversation and what parts may be forgotten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're having a lengthy conversation on the ChatGPT web app and it relies on information from the start, consider copying and pasting the necessary parts into a new chat to avoid losing crucial context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools like <a href="https://www.typingmind.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypingMind</a> allow users to selectively cut unimportant parts of the conversation and even direct the chat from a selected point. This ability to manually manage the conversation can provide a more controlled experience with ChatGPT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ChatGPT and other similar models, like GPT-3 and GPT-4, are designed to be stateless for a variety of reasons, such as scalability, efficiency, and data privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While their stateless nature makes these models safe and manageable at scale, the lack of memory and contextual retention is a limitation when it comes to personalization and continuous learning. Layered implementations like <a href="https://www.langchain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LangChain</a>, <a href="https://www.llamaindex.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LlamaIndex</a>, and <a href="https://haystack.deepset.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haystack</a> help in managing this constraint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As more advanced versions like GPT-4 with 8,192 and 32,768 context lengths and GPT-4 Turbo with a 128k context length come up, it enables longer conversations. However, there will always be a completion limit, currently at about 3,000 words (4,096 tokens) for GPT-4 Turbo. This completion limit may come as a surprise given the much larger <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">128k context of the model.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trying to dialogue with these models without providing the entire conversation effectively erases the memory of prior interactions, making them less effective in terms of continuity and coherence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future technological advances and updates may amend some of these constraints, enhancing the AI's ability to maintain long and complex conversations while also respecting user data privacy.</p>
