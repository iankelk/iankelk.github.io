This necessitated a three-mile cart ride in public from Newgate prison to the gallows. Huge crowds collected on the way and followed the accused to Tyburn. They were used as the gallows for London offenders from the 16th century until 1759."	Conspiratory papers	A printer named William Anderton was accused and executed for high treason on account of the pamphlets he printed. Anderton had established a secret press in Westminster, where he was accused works against King William III, claiming his regime to be used by the Dutch to drain the population of its wealth, and that the revolution which put William in power was part of a foreign conspiracy to start a war between England and France. Instead, he defended the reinstatement of the deposed king James II. It was likely that his work was financed by others, and part of a greater network in the context of the Jacobite Rebellion, a movement in support of King James II.

João Glama Ströberle - Lisbon Museum	Catholic Church's explanation of Lisbon Earthquake	Before the science of seismology was invented, the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake was a catastrophic phenomenon that defied explanation and deeply affected Europe's perception of religion, philosophy and politics. The earthquake's devastation wsa followed by a tsunami and a fire, destroying most of the city's churches, filled with churchgoers at the time of the earthquake. In this context, the Catholic Church's explanation of the earthquake as a form of wrath of God was challenged by thinkers of the time, and pamphlets questioning this version spread throughout Europe, being a part of the Enlightenment period, and inspiring the thinker Voltaire to write his book Candide.

Fake Peace Treaty	As Britain was preparing to end the Treaty of Amiens and declare war on France, a letter was hand delivered to Sir Charles Price, the Lord Mayor of London. Allegedly written by Lord Hawkesbury, the letter claimed that the dispute with France was amicably settled. The mayor took the letter to the Stock Exchange to share the joyous news. Meanwhile, suspicions about the validity of the letter were raised, and enquiries ensued. It was determined that the letter was indeed a forgery, but by then, it was too late. Many stocks had changed hands at inflated rates. All attempts to identify the perpetrator of the hoax failed.

Illustration from an 1836 English pamphlet, publisher unknown. Note the biped beavers on the right	Aliens on moon hoax	In a series of articles, the New York Sun claimed that there was an alien civilization on the moon, which were falsely attributed to a well-known astronomer of the time named Sir John Herschel. The article reported that Herschel had made these discoveries using new “hydro-oxygen magnifiers” and went on to describe how the discovery was made. This “Great Moon Hoax” established the Sun as a leading, profitable newspaper.
5	1890	United States of America	yellow-journalism.jpg	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/PulitzerHearstWarYellowKids.jpg	https://european-seed.com/2022/09/fake-news-throughout-history/	Editorial cartoon by Leon Barritt, 1898. Newspaper publishers Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst, full-length, dressed as the Yellow Kid (a popular cartoon character of the day), each pushing against opposite sides of a pillar of wooden blocks that spells WAR. This is a satire of the Pulitzer and Hearst newspapers' role in drumming up USA public opinion to go to war with Spain.	Yellow Journalism	Rival U.S. newspaper publishers Joseph Pulitzer and William Hearst competed over the audience through sensationalism and reporting rumours as though they were facts, a practice that became known at the time as “yellow journalism.” Their incredulous news played a role in leading the U.S. into the Spanish-American War of 1898. Eventually there was a backlash against the lack of journalistic integrity: The public demanded more objective and reliable news sources, which created a niche that The New York Times was able to fill at the turn of the 20th century. Yellow journalism became less common. That is, until the rise of web-based news brought it all back in full force.

There was a state-wide boycott of eggs planned by the women and public officials. Then, Chicago newspapers came out with headlines of “Eggs Drop Ten Cents” and “Cost of Living Smashed”. But the following day, it became apparent that this was nothing but fake news since the retail grocers in the city continued selling eggs at the same price. It was alleged that the newspapers were in cahoots with the food retailers. The prices continued to fluctuate with supply and demand and the cost of eggs continued to rise steadily in the years following the 1916 boycotts.

Now, long after the war, the story has been attributed to MI7, who spread this false story through the newspapers as a special correspondent for the Daily Express.

During the broadcast, the first two thirds of the story were aired over the radio as a series of breaking news alerts and the effect was so realistic that many listeners panicked, believing that there truly was an alien invasion taking place. Before the end of the broadcast, doctors, nurses, soldiers, and sailors reported for duty, ready to fight the Martians. Producers of the show were quite unprepared for this response, never thinking that anyone would believe that the broadcast was real.

The paper, subsequently retracted, was based on manipulations of the data by Andrew Wakefield, who had financial interests in the sale of test kits for the "condition". Though the paper was retracted and Wakefield lost his medical license, vaccination for MMR dropped significantly after the publishing and outbreaks continue to happen in the 21st century.

COVID-19 Cow Dung Cure	Almost straight from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of false and inaccurate information emerged, and was spread online. It was mainly about the COVID-19 virus, its origins and effects, cures and remedies, and the actions taken by the government or public health officials to manage the pandemic. One such "treatment" propagated in the province of Gujarat, in Western India, was to spread cow dung and urine on one's body to "ward off covid".

It continues to circulate strongly in both countries and the spreaders are employing coordinated efforts across multiple platforms, with social media such as Telegram and TikTok, mainstream media outlets, and propaganda-based websites all being used to sway the emotions and beliefs of ordinary citizens in the two countries and around the world.
